  </h2>
  <br>
  <p class="lead">
   Each node consists of several parts; notably a dylos system, alphasense sensors, printed circuit boards, an analog to digital converter, and a raspberry pi. Every node has a dylos that consists of a small computer fan, a laser system that measures particulate matter and a screen that displays the results. This original setup was modified to also channel air over a RH/Temp Sensor and through a 3D printed infrastructure that houses the four alphasense sensors. Alphasense sensors are electrochemical sensors that measure the concentration of pollutants. Our sensors include CO, NO, NO2 and O3 sensors along with a RH Temperature sensor. 
   <br>
   <br>

   The PCB, or printed circuit board, is a mini computer that serves two purposes. It distributed power to various components of the node and communicates the data collected by the alphasense sensors and RH/Temperature sensor to the ADC board. The ADC, or analog to Digital converter, received analog input and then converts it into digital data that the Raspberry Pi can read. The Raspberry Pi receives digital data from the ADC board through the ribbon cable. Ultimately, this information is transferred wirelessly to a database.

We are measuring five pollutants: nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter. The NOx group (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) is emitted from automobiles, power plants, and turbines. Carbon monoxide comes from automobile exhaust and burning fuel. Particulate matter is the result of a wide range of manmade and natural sources, while ozone is the result of reactions between chemicals already in our air.
Together, these pollutants paint a comprehensive picture of air quality impacts from the interaction of human activity with natural processes.

    <h3>Carbon Monoxide</h3>
    <p>
      CO is an odorless, colorless gas that is highly toxic in when encountered in high concentrations! The main contribution of CO is vehicle exhaust but other sources include fuel combustion, fires, and volcanoes. Harmful health effects of CO occur when it enters the bloodstream through the lungs and binds to hemoglobin, reducing the amount of oxygen that reaches the bodys' tissues and organs.

        <p>
          What is it?  Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless, and toxic gas that is often a byproduct of combustion in gas ranges, automobiles, or unvented kerosene heaters. CO can also be an important indoor pollution concern, because it is often produced from indoor heaters, chimneys and furnaces, fireplaces, and water heaters. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does it matter?  Because carbon monoxide is difficult to detect and might be a critical indoor pollution problem, our network is especially useful for CO detection. At low concentrations, it can cause mild chest pain in people with heart problems or fatigue in healthy people. CO can be fatal at high concentrations, because of its ability to limit oxygen intake in blood. Other potential issues include angina, impaired vision, and reduced brain function.

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>
          What is it?  Nitric oxide (NO) is a byproduct of combustion of air in manmade systems such as automobile engines and fossil fuel power plants, or in natural processes such as thunderstorms. NO is a free radical (it has one unpaired electron), which means that it is highly unstable and likely rapidly reacts with surrounding gases. Usually, NO converts into nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which will enter a complex chain of reactions that may produce ozone or acid rain. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does it matter? NO is not included in the Air Quality Index (AQI) produced by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, it is an important precursor to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which is known to have detrimental effects on human respiratory health. NO2 can also likely produce ozone or acid rain.

      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        <p>
          What is it? Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a suffocating, brownish gas that belongs to a family of highly reactive species known as nitrogen oxides (NOx). NO2 is usually produced after nitric oxide, which is produced from automobiles and industrial processes, rapidly decomposes to NO2. The NOx gases form when fuel is burned at high temperatures  as a result of motor vehicle exhaust, electric utilities, and industrial boilers. NO2 can react with other gases in the atmosphere to form nitric acid, which leads to acid rain, and ozone.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Why does it matter?  At moderate levels, NO2 can cause lung irritation and make one more susceptible to respiratory illnesses such as influenza. Nitrogen dioxide, when present for prolonged time periods, can make children more susceptible to acute respiratory illness. NO2 can increase acid rain and formation of zone. Finally, NO2 can result in eutrophication in waters, which decreases water oxygen and threatens the livelihood of aquatic wildlife.

        <p>
          What is it?  Ozone is a gas that occurs both in the upper atmosphere and at ground level. Both regions of ozone have the same chemical makeup: O3. Upper atmospheric ozone protects the earth from UV rays, but ground level ozone can pose a threat. 
          Ozone is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight. Major sources of NOx and VOC include motor vehicle exhaust, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does it matter?  Ozone exposure on the ground level (troposphere) can pose a significant health risk, especially for children with asthma. It can also damage crops, trees and other vegetation. It is a main component of urban smog. However,  it is important to note that ozone in the stratosphere actually shields earth from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.

          What is it? Particulate matter, also known as particle pollution or PM, is a broad category of small particles and liquid droplets. PM consists of substances such as nitrates, sulfates, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. PM-2.5 are particles that have a diameter with 2.5 micrometers or less, and are generally referred to as “fine particles”. These particles tend to be found in smoke and haze, such as from urban air pollution and forest fires. They can also form from reactions between gases emitted from power plants, industries, and automobiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does it matter? Because PM-2.5 are finer particles, they are more likely to enter and settle in human lungs. Young children or the elderly are more susceptible to effects from PM-2.5. In addition, people who exercise frequently outdoors are more vulnerable to health effects of PM-2.5, since particle uptake is higher during physical activity. Particles often contain microscopic solids or liquid droplets that have been scientifically shown to aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma, increase likelihood of premature death in people with heart and lung disease, and induce irregular heartbeat.

PM consists of substances such as nitrates, sulfates, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. PM-10 are particles that have a diameter of 10 micrometers or less, and are referred to as respirable suspended particles (RSP). PM-10 can come in the form of soot or dust and is usually found near roadways or dusty industrial sites. These particles are coarser than PM-2.5 but are still considered to be a health hazard. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does it matter?  Because PM-10 are coarser than PM-2.5, and therefore less likely to get buried deep within lungs and cause respiratory ailments. However, PM-10 is similar to PM-2.5 in that it most strongly affects young children, the elderly, and frequent outdoor exercisers. Like PM-2.5, it can contribute to health problems such as more pronounced asthma and bronchitis, and weakened immune systems.

  <p class="lead">
    Air quality is monitored in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which determines air quality using a composite Air Quality Index (AQI). We devised our own AQI by adjusting for the unique measurement schemes calibrated on our sensor nodes. The index determines overall quality based on concentrations of fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and ozone. Concentrations are used to produce an index value, ranging from good to unhealthy.
